## Biography

> Maria L. Martins - I'm a biochemist who has always been fascinated by biophysical techniques and how we can use these tools to unravel the mechanisms governing protein dynamics and interactions. I joined DSB lab back in 2019 to do my **master thesis in NMR and protein-ligand interactions**, gaining some expertise in this field. After that, I wanted to expand my field of knowledge and to learn a bit of everything to develop my problem-solving skills. I was introduced to Bio-SAXS, confocal microscopy techniques and more advanced molecular biology tools, all of which allowed me to participate in several side projects and enrich my own. Right now, I’m more interested in **liquid-liquid phase separation** and how we can tune these properties in our favor. I am currently doing my **PhD in Molecular Biosciences**, and I actively participate in science promoting events within ITQB, either for the scientific community or to the general public.

## Research Interests

- Phase separation (LLPS)
- Structural biology (NMR, SAXS)
- Enzymatic Catalysis
