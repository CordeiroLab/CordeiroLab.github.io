## Biography

> Maria L. Martins - I'm a biochemist who has always been fascinated by biophysical techniques and how we can use these tools to unravel the mechanisms governing protein dynamics and interactions. I joined DSB lab back in 2019 to do my master thesis in NMR and protein-ligand interactions, gaining some expertise in this field. After that, I wanted to expand my field of knowledge and to learn a bit of everything to develop my problem-solving skills. I was introduced to Bio-SAXS, confocal microscopy techniques and more advanced molecular biology tools, all of which allowed me to participate in several side projects and enrich my own. Right now, I’m more interested in liquid-liquid phase separation and how we can tune these properties in our favor. I am currently doing my PhD in Molecular Biosciences, and I actively participate in science promoting events within ITQB, either for the scientific community or to the general public.
## Research Interests
