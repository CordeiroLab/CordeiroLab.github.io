## Biography
Marco Saraiva - Currently, I am the PI of an **[exploratory project](https://doi.org/10.54499/2023.12910.PEX)** recently approved by FCT in the Dynamic and Structural Biology lab (aka Cordeiro lab). My interest in research is vast and spans from mass spectrometry to biophysics. While away from experimental research for some years, I tried to keep in touch with science and publish. In this new opportunity, I intend to elevate science to new ways of understanding biological processes and to share my knowledge with students along the way. 

## Research Interests

- Biophysical characterization
- Self-assembly & protein aggregation
- Physical Chemistry
