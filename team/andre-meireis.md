## Biography

> **André Meireis** - I’m a molecular biologist with a passion for biomedicine and fascinated with scientific research, from the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms responsible for disease to translational research applied to these mechanisms in order to unravel new approaches to modern medicine. After a bachelor’s degree in Cell and Molecular Biology I pursued a master’s degree in Molecular Genetics and Biomedicine and graduated with a thesis in the field of nanomedicine where I researched about the possible therapeutical effects of gold nanoparticles in colorectal cancer. I joined the **DSB lab** in 2023 as research fellow to obtain hands on experience on the life of scientific research where I was able to develop and master a myriad of soft and hard skills. During this time, I was responsible for protein purification and through nuclear magnetic resonance and enzymatic assays I studied the interaction between an intrinsically disordered protein from *E.coli* and a human phosphatase in the context of host-pathogen interactions. PhD student since the start of 2026 in the 1st edition of the GIMM CAML Biology and Biomedicine PhD program.
