> Unique class of proteins

## Biography
>  Image proteins that never settle in one shape. Instead, they wiggle around and adapt like microscopic spaghetti. These are IDPs, under-represented "heroes" of Biology that drive critical cellular processes, from gene regulation to disease defence. For decades, science overlooked IDPS, believing only structured ones are functional. But now, we know that disorder is like a "superpower". Their plasticity renders the ability to interact with multiple partners (HUB).  Cordeiro Lab works to unveil how their superpowers underlie biology and health—finding ways to target these undruggable targets.

## Key Features
- Lack a fixed 3D structure
- High flexibility and dynamics
- Can undergo disorder-to-order transitions
- Common in eukaryotic proteomes 
- Function through disorder 
- Associated with disease
- Difficult to study using traditional structural biology  & AI tool
