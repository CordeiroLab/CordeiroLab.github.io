## Biography
Nuno P. Fernandes - During my Biochemistry bachelor's at the University of Lisbon, I realized the potential of **scientific software** to not only contribute to the efficiency of wet lab work but also to further advance scientific knowledge through the power of simulation. In search of new challenges and aiming to increase my knowledge on the interface between computers and the life sciences, I decided to pursue a **Master's in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics** at ITQB NOVA. I chose to do my dissertation project at the Dynamic Structural Biology Lab (aka Cordeiro Lab), focusing on the **development of computational tools to generate conformational ensembles** that aid in the study of **intrinsically disordered proteins**. Being in the DSB lab allowed me to learn much more about this protein class directly from field experts. Additionally, having direct contact with protein researchers helped me improve my understanding of their needs, contributing to my ability to develop useful and user-friendly software, accessible to any who wish to use it.
