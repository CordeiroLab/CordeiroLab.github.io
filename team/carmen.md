## Biography

>Carmen Olivença - I’m a biologist deeply passionate about bacterial development, with a particular focus on the complex process of spore formation in *Clostridioides difficile*. My Master’s research centered on **YabG, a cysteine protease** crucial for the assemble of the spore surface layers. This work ignited my curiosity about the molecular mechanisms that govern protein function and inspired me to continue investigating this topic in my PhD, within the Molecular Biosciences program at ITQB NOVA under the supervision of [Professor Adriano O.Henriques](https://www.itqb.unl.pt/research/biology/microbial-development/microbial-development#GM) and Dr. Tiago N.Cordeiro. To explore YabG’s structure and dynamics in more detail, I joined the Dynamic Structural Biology Lab (DSBL) (aka Cordeiro Lab), where I now apply techniques like SAXS and NMR to investigate how this protein behaves at the molecular level and how its structural features influence its activity. Combining microbiology and structural biology has been crucial to my research. DSBL has played a key role in my growth as a scientist by exposing me to advanced biophysical techniques and computational modeling—fields that were completely new to me. This interdisciplinary environment has enriched my project and transformed the way I approach scientific questions.
