## Biography

> Guillem Hernandez Gras - He is a multidisciplinar scientist that after a BSc in Chemistry and a MSc in Organic Chemistry by University of Barcelona decided to keep broadening his field of knowledge by jumping into a PhD in Molecular biosciences in a different country. He employed a hybrid approach, combining high and low resolution structural characterization techniques with biophysics and computational techniques, to explore the structure and dynamics of IDPs essential for the development of life-threatening infections.
Combining his knowledge, his passion for learning and teaching and his will to contribute, Guillem participated in many collaborations during his PhD and was deeply involved in the training of the newcomers to the lab in the early years of the Dynamic Structural Biology Group at ITQB.
PhD holder since early 2024, he is now involved in the Sales and Scientific Project Development for a Swiss multinational company
