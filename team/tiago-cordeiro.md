## Biography
>I am a scientist passionate about understanding how intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and phase separation organize **biomolecular processes**, contribute to **pathogen survival**, and drive **biotechnological innovation**. I lead the Dynamic Structural Biology Lab at ITQB-NOVA, where we combine advanced biophysical techniquesmainly **SAXS** and **NMR**—with **computational modeling** to investigate the structural dynamics of IDPs and their assemblies.
My academic journey began with a Chemistry degree from IST-ULisboa, followed by a Master of Advanced Studies in Organic Chemistry at the University of Barcelona, and a PhD in biomolecular NMR. After postdoctoral research in France and Denmark—supported by a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship**—I founded my independent research group in 2017.
To date, I’ve authored **over 30 peer-reviewed publications**, secured national and European funding, and mentored students at all academic levels. I am deeply committed to advancing our understanding of protein dynamics and translating fundamental discoveries into innovative biotechnological and healthcare applications.
