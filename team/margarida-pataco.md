## Biography

> Margarida Pataco - For Margarida's early career development, being the first intern of the lab during her undergraduate studies (Cellular and Molecular Biology - FCT NOVA) was particularly significant. This two-month voluntary internship provided her with hands-on experience in standard molecular research techniques, including cloning and gel-agarose electrophoresis, along with SDS-PAGE analysis. These foundational skills likely contributed to her analytical capabilities in her later transition to SAP consulting and biotechnology applications.
This role as the lab's inaugural intern demonstrates her initiative and willingness to engage with new initiatives from the early stages of her career.
