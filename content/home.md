# Exploring the Unstructured: Where Disorder Drives Discovery
>***Welcome to the Cordeiro Lab** — where curiosity meets cutting-edge science to uncover how **intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)** and **phase separation** shape **microbial life** and **enzyme catalysis**. Join us as we explore the molecular logic of pathogens and pioneer new solutions in **IDP-based biotechnology.***

## Image proteins that never settle in one shape. Instead, they wiggle around and adapt like microscopic spaghetti. 
## These are IDPs, under-represented "heroes" of Biology that drive critical cellular processes, from gene regulation to disease defence. 
## For decades, science overlooked IDPS, believing only structured ones are functional. But now, we know that disorder is like a "superpower". Their plasticity renders the ability to interact with multiple partners (HUBs). 
## We work to unveil how their superpowers underlie biology and health—finding ways to target these undruggable targets.*
